  <h1>Biography</h1>
  <h2>Short</h2>
  <p>
    Noe Alvarado is an IT professional that does away with tradition and inspires teams to experiment and innovate so that “IT works for people”. While unorthodox, the benefits for his employers are clear: lower labor costs, optimized business
    processes, and increased team cohesion. Noe continually attends conferences, earns certifications and is active in local meetups to find better ways of “making IT work for people”. At home, he enjoys spending time with his family, reading, or
    practicing martial arts.

  </p>

  <h2>Full Biography</h2>
  <p>
    Noe was born to in Garden Grove, CA, a son to 2 loving, Mexican immigrant parents. Growing up, Noe was as normal as anyone else; He would role play characters from his favorite films, battle it out in strategy and card games, and occasionally
    exercise due to team sports. The idea of being an engineer, or working with computers was foreign. Too poor to buy a computer or training, yet too committed to other hobbies to take part in it.. However, his AVID teacher entertained the idea of
    becoming an engineer because it tailored to his strengths and his desire for a good challenge. After that day, he set his mind to becoming a computer engineer, and becoming the first college graduate in his family.
    He attended CSU Fullerton to studying computer engineering and struggled like anyone else failing Calculus and Programming 3 times. However, the lesson of perseverance from his parents inspired him to continue his studies. He continued to endure
    through the studies yet the odds of him obtaining an opportunity seemed slim; He had average grades and his participation in numerous extracurricular activities hadn’t helped his odds. He graduated in 2017 and like other graduates, he cast his
    resume into the ocean of employers but received no offers. Luckily, his friend invited him to apply to his company; he was hired that day and after having hungered for such an opportunity, he was determined to prove himself.
    At SJK, he began learning the various systems in IT and ensured he provided effective help desk support to the different business units. But he wanted to learn more; he wanted to prove himself. Through self-study, and attended hacker
    conferences, Noe would earn 10 certifications in 2018 and brought back the most useful tips of advice that could improve the IT systems. His most admirable accomplishments remain in the areas of security, team leadership, business process
    improvement, and desktop support. Currently, he is actively self-studying to become a full-stack engineer and continues to find areas in IT systems that can be made better, faster, or more secure.
